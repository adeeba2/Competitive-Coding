Hello Coach,

I apologize for my mistake.It wasn't my peice of code neither I intend to present it as my own work.After writting my code,for self-improvement,I usually read others code.This allows me to get famillar with some good coding styles as well as it helps me to improve the quality of code I write.By doing this not only I discover the areas which has a lot of room for improvement but also I get to know various techniques of refactoring and refining the code.
The same thing I did it with this project,while googling I found out this project (https://github.com/allanbreyes/resume/blob/3bd2592599720b29ef11e2dea01af12aa31dc582/js/resumeBuilder.js).I modified the code to compare it with that of mine.But while submitting the repository I mistakenly submitted the wrong repository,instead of submitting mine I submitted his modified code by mistake as both were of the simillar names.My intentions was just to learn from it.I have my code with me and would like to submit the same.Hope you unserstand,I regret for the inconvenience caused.
Regards,
Saurabh Jain
